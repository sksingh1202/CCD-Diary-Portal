# CCD-Diary-Portal
This project is for a website that serves as a portal to be used by the members
of the Centre for Career and Development(CCD) team of IIT Guwahati. It is a Diary
which would consist of a log of the relations made by the Person of Coordination
(POC) and the Co-Person of Coordination (CPOC) with the companies which would
take part in the placement and the internship season. It would also facilitate
them to add remarks for their convenience.
